### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey hey... Welcome to my Github page, here you will find a lot of what I do related to code, work and research projects. My main interests are Education, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I use these deep computer science concepts to learn more about how to combine software craftsmanship with real world needs.

## My current projects are:

- LAF (Learn Anything Faster)
- Life calendar (based on Tim Urban's ted talk)
- Random Music Generator from image capture

### My future project are:
- Acronym status update (YTBC)
- Vibration sensor (I saw a cool video online of someone using a sensor to detect if their washer had finished the cycle and send an SMS notification)


* This page only exists because I have a repo with my username, do it is pretty cool :)
